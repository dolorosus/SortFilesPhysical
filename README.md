# SortFilesPhysical
Sort a folders contents in physical order

Sometimes it is necessary to physically sort the contents of a directory. This can be done by moving the contents file by file to a temporary folder.

The script requests the folder whose content is to be sorted and moves the content file by file to a folder called "sorted".

After the script has finished the contents of the folder "sorted" can be moved to the desired position in filesystem.
