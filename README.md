# SortFilesPhysical
Sort a folders contents in physical order

Sometimes it is necessary to physically sort the contents of a directory. This can be done by moving the contents piece by piece to a temporary folder.

The script requests the folder whose contents are to be sorted and moves the contents piece by piece to a folder called "sorted".

After the script has finished the contents of the folder "XXXX" can be moved to the desired position.
